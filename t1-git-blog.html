<h2>What Are the Benefits Of Versions Control</h2>
<p>
Okay so your new at Git and you're wanting to know a bit more about version control?
We'll it just so has it that at this moment I'm writing, I've been in your shoes right now! Weird right? 

Ok so this might not be the best explaination on the world about Version control but a least it might give you a good starting point. 

Version Control - Does exactley what it says. It controls all versions of your code. It's like a management system that's been put together by some geniuses who knew there would be other crazy people out there doing what what they're doing, yeah seems a bit mad right? Not really ... very clever in fact. We all know how frustrated we get when we've been working away at an assignment, blog post, or anything that requires a word processor and then all of a sudden, either the computer crashes, or we get interupted, or whatever the circumstances, our work gets destroyed and we didn't save it, make a copy of it or back it up. Yip, super frustrating! 
 
Well version control is designed to completley avoid those situations. It's just like saving, making a copy or backing up your code on a consistent basis, but this has to be initialised by you. It's a little smarter than just doing those 3 things, it actually takes snap shots of your code so you can go back in time and look at the specific version of code in that very instance. It's like time Machine on a Mac. Although you will most likely be using it to manage your code, version control can be used with any file on your computer. 

So that's my understanding of version control, I have to leave it here as I'm running out of time, but keep reading as Ii'll let you know how you can mamnge this system and I'll tell you what application is best for running it. 
</p>

<h2>How Does Git Help Keep Track Of Changes?</h2>
<p>Git is the system I was referring to early when talking about those crazy guys helping save our info! Git exists on every computer and is responsible for managing versions of your projects. It comes with pre defined functions that allow you to save, track and monitor your cersions. 
So for example when you want to start a project and use git to manage it you would start with the command 'git init' which registers the project with git telling it you want to start tracking this project so make provision for it please. You would then type into your terminal 'git add' and that would tell git 'Hey Git, I have my first version and I'm about to save it into your storage facility, so get ready' you'd then type 'git commit 'm "Message here"' and git would then save that version permantley in it's system for you to reference if you wanted to. 
</p>
<h4>GIT HEAD</h4>
<p>So git's got a thing called HEAD and that thing if you call it will tell you exactley which version it is sitting on, so if you we're working on a large project and you wanted to create a different version of your code so you could play around with some really cool idea, you could make another version of it, which starts to complicate things a little, so luckily we can tell exactley where we are and where want to go using the 'GIT HEAD' ... it's really called the HEAD not GIT HEAD. SO that's pretty much how that works. It pay to go and look up a bit more about it though because it's a pretty useful tool. 
</p>

<h2>GitHub</h2>

<p>Now I've been telling you about the concept of Git and you know that Git exists locally on your computer. We'll imagine doing all of this stuff on the cloud and be able to share all of your project and collaborate with team mates and employees and whoever else is has an interest in the project. That would be super handy right? We'll that's exactley what GitHub does, it's just an online version of Git, but has a far wider reaching benefit for teamwork. Escpecially when it comes to open source projects. GIthub also allows you to sync with you local git, which is also pretty handy as well, so no double handling. Anyway that's my take on Version control and Git. Hope you enjoyed and good luck with yours.

P.S I have written this blog post inside of the commandline and I'll be sending it shortly to GitHub all without having to swap windows. pretty awesome experience!
