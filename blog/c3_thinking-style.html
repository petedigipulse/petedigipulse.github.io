     <h4>My Thinking Style & How I Can Take Advantage</h4>
      	<p>From memory, of the term they used by Gregorc Thinking Style, it was Multi Modal. Which basically translated into all forms of media, like videos, print, kinesthetic, etc. So in essence whatever modal I could get my hands on to help me understand a concept was good for me. Sometimes when doing a lot of research look at a couple of videos first to give me an overview of the topic and then I like to read as I can stay in control of the subject matter for example if there was something I thought I could skip, I would just skip, which you can't do in video. </p>
        <p>So I guess what I'm trying to say is it depends on the extent if the research and the depth of the material determines how I am going to learn. If anything it will be video and reading.</p>

        <p> How did it differ to what I experienced over the last 3 weeks?</p>
        <p>I don't think it really differed too much, I do recall after reading and watching material and still not getting it, that it eventually came to me by actually getting stuck in and doing it. So I guess you could say I learn by doing!</p>

        <p>I think I tend to learn a lot quicker now that I look back on it, is by just jumping into irb and testing it.</p>

        <p>This to me makes sense as I can kill two critical birds with one stone. Those being 1. Practicing what I've researched as well as researching what I've practiced. 2. Practice what I've learned ie once I've got the grasp of something, there still needs time to be allocated towards crafting and improving on the skill to become proficient with it.</p>

        <p>I think going forward, I need to set aside more time to practice what I've learned so it becomes ingrained into how I programme. </p>
