    <h1>What's The Difference Between Relative, Absolute Fixed Positioning?</h1>
    <p>
      So this was a bit if a challange for me the first time I learnt about positioning.
      My other challange was trying to position HTML elements with Margin, Border and Padding.<p>

      <p>I did find it really enjoyable learning HTML and CSS, I'd only ever worked in Dreamweaver, which builds all the code for you. So to be able to actually write the code from scratch and see it all come a live, I thought was pretty awesome.<p>

      <p>So lets start with the basics to see if we can understand this positioning thing properly</p>
      <p>We'll start with the law of Relativety, Absolutness and Fixed Positioning</p>
      <p>I'll first give you a brief overview and I'll get into the nitty gritty and at the end I'll finish off with a bit on the boxed model we all know as Margin, Border and Padding.</p>


      <p>So the first thing you should know is that there's one more element that's been missed out here and that's the static position. It's the default position for every element that you create.</p>

      <p>With that said lets move onto the Big 3. </p>


      <h3>The Big Three</h3>

      <ol>

          <li>Relative</li>

          <li>Absolute<li>

          <li>Fixed</li>

      </ol>

      <h3>The Other Big Three</h3>
       <ol>
          <li>Margin<li>

          <li>Border</li>

          <li>Padding</li>

      </ol>
