  <h2>What I think about the Dev Academy Experience</h2>

  <h1>What's my take on the video regarding EDA?</h1>
  <p>It pleasing to know that my initial take when I first came across EDA was backed up by Shereed in this video. I have had an interesting upbringing, leaving school without a qualification<br></br>
, and pretty much being self employed as a contractor or consultant I had figured that whatever I was going to get out of EDA would be completley up to me. When talking to freinds and family<br></br> 
I the typical response was, do you get any sort of certificate or qualification from it, do they guaranteee you a job at the end it all? ... and my typical response was no, but i'm not that naive to think that there is anything else there that will guarantee me what I'm looking to get out of it. So it's going to be completely up to me make sure I get the most out of it. It also suits <br></br>
the way I think and the way I learn, which is very independant if traditional ways of learning and doing!<br></br><br></br>
I think whole makeup aligns with the EDA experience, so much so that making the decision to do EDA was not a concious descision other than running it past my wife. After viewing the material my
thinking was more about how I was going to do it rather than if I was going to do it. <b></br><br></br>
My impression of EDA again aligns with the way I think, I have always been a self learn and a life learner, so I love the fact that it was conceived around a 'this is an experiment' concept<br></br>
as I believe that some the traditional education institutes are too rigourous in terms of boxed thinking rather than agile, especially in the tech industry as things develop so rapidly, so <br></br>
much so that by the time someone graduates from a 3 year degree, what they've learned is probably going to be out of date, so to me it's a bit like all of the stuff you where taught at school<br></br> 
is going to be redundant by the time you get a job and apply it to real world applications.  
In a bizaare kind of way I am into failing fast as it suits my kind of learning as long as I don't make the same mistake twice. I think that if you fail you get to learn alot more than if you were to get things done quickly.<br></br>
The perfect example is making a mistake with my blog on GitHub, I put it in the wrong directory and it took me while to figure it out and how to get make to it's normal state, while I was going <br></br>
through that process I managed to learned a lot more about GitHub than if I got it right the first time. To me this is the natural state of learning and we have been doing this since we were first born.<br></br>

       I am super excited to have the opportunity to engage in this sort of culture in-fact probably relieved more so, as I had a firm believe that businesses just don't work in this kind of environment<br></br>
hence the reason I've never worked for anyone else. I just thought businesses where just big dumb institutes and the only companies that do have the smarts at appreciating staff and growth are <br></br>
companies like Google or Apple etc. I am also glad that EDA is inviting business in to help educate them into how an agile envornment works. Businesses need more educating on this type of environment.<br></br>
